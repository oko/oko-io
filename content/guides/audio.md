## What I use now

### Output

* JDS Labs [Atom DAC](https://jdslabs.com/product/atom-dac-plus/) and [Atom Amp](https://jdslabs.com/product/atom-amp/)
    * [RCA cable to bridge DAC to amp](https://jdslabs.com/product/stack-rca-cables/)
* Multiple options for headphones. Choose one.
    * Closed-back
        * [Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-770-PRO-Studio-Headphone/dp/B0006NL5SM), specifically the 250-ohm version
        * [Audio-Technica ATH-M50X](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86)
    * Open-back
        * [Hifiman HE5XX](https://drop.com/buy/drop-hifiman-he5xx)
        * [Sennheiser HD6XX](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx)

### Input

* [Motu M2 mixer](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m2/)
* [Shure SM7B microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M)
    * [Triton Audio Fethead inline pre-amp](https://www.amazon.com/TRITON-AUDIO-FetHead-Microphone-Preamp/dp/B06XDPTDN5)
    * [Amazon Basics XLR cable](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Standard-Microphone-Noise-Cancelling/dp/B01JNLUMMW) required to connect mic to pre-amp + mixer

## Alternative setup for input

The M2 + SM7B setup is ~$600. You can knock $430 off that and just buy a [Rode NT-USB](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-NT-USB-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00MMKQOEM) podcasting mic.

## Equalization

I use [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) to apply EQ profiles from the [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq) project's GraphicEQ curves. All listed headphones have EQ profiles available.
