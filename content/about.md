Hi, I'm Jacob!

I grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities with a B.S. in Computer Science.

I previously worked at an early-stage startup in San Francisco and a bootstrapped software-as-a-service company in the Midwest. I currently work for Facebook in Menlo Park as a Production Engineer.

I raced road bicycles from 2012 to 2019 and still ride recreationally.

My GitHub account is [`@oko`](https://github.com/oko).
